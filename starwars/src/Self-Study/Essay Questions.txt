1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.
    React JS, is simplifying vanilla js to be simpler in using API, and programs that are heavy with adaptive information. 
    It alows the DOM to be continually updated without manually making edits.

2. What does it mean to think in react?
    I think react is to the object oriented. Where you do a little here and there and all around passing 
    Information back and forth making the code cleaner.

3. Describe state.
    State is the from of the web, it compilies once and waits for somethign specific to change, if not it'll 
    Be static for the rest of the time.

4. Describe props.
    Props, or properties are short hand for passing an api and other properties in a simplified way.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?
    Side effects are changes that are made inherintely. You can sync effects by writing out a useEffect for something 
    Fetching an API, that way in manages changes.
